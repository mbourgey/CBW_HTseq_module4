Most of the variant have keep the same genotpes but it improve call in supicious site such as 1:17,841,784-17,841,823.

Also some new variant appears such as the one at position 1:17,826,542-17,826,580. This one has been called but then we removed it due to low QD.

Or at position 1:17,822,491-17,822,569 where the variant was missed at individual call.


In a general manner the more information is provided, the more accurate and the more sensitive the genotype call are.
