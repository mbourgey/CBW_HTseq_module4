Probably yes but very few !


for example in region 1:17,730,458-17,730,509 or 1:17,764,435-17,764,476 which prove that no caller is perfect. 

But in these regions the missing variant are in a middle of a strech of the same letter which may be complicated to align reads and call variants. And maybe these one are not real
