Yes most of them look believable, but sometime in region with lower coverage the call coul be more ambigous 

for example in region 1:17,792,577-17,792,646 SNP is supicious because 

  1. Mix of indel and SNP 
  2. Most of the variant evidences are on the same reads strand for both SNPs or on the edge of the read 
  3. The region is a long strech of `T` which is prone to misalignment
